## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - For development

### What I learned

Trying out both Tailwind css and Vite for development. The tailwind css has been hard to learn because of the number of css classes. But if I work with it more it should come naturally.  
Vite was a buzz word that I wanted to test and it seems to work fine but together with tailwind it was hard to set up so tailwind would apply the utility classes that I had entered in the html. Sometimes the changes didn't appear and it took some time to get it working again. 
I think I can try to use tailwind config a lot more in future projects. 


### Continued development

- Continue investigating both Vite and Tailwind for future projects.
- Continue to try out grid instead of flex next time.
- Read up on github pages. How to set up a different branch to get a live version of the code. (This I found on information about on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy))
